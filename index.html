                <p> The recent flood has caused devastation to many families in various communities throughout Quebec. Despite the heartache itâ€™s been heart-warming to see communities come together in order to support flood victims. Many of us are donating food to help families in need.</p>

                <h3>Education for a child</h3>
                <p>Children should be taught to avoid water when unsupervised. After a storm occurs, puddles are natural temptations, but creeks, ditches, basically any area overflowing with water can be dangerous. Water does not always indicate its depth, and what looks like a shallow puddle may be a hole, several feet deep.</p>

                <p> Many people lost their homes, and it was crucial to construct transitional shelters for some of the most vulnerable people affected by the flood.More than 37,000 people are still staying in the shelters of Sylhet. They took refuge there after a devastating flash flood swept through the Sylhet division and some other parts of the country recently, leaving 95 people dead.</p>
