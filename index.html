                <p> The recent flood has caused devastation to many families in various communities throughout Quebec. Despite the heartache itâ€™s been heart-warming to see communities come together in order to support flood victims. Many of us are donating food to help families in need.</p>

                <p>Children should be taught to avoid water when unsupervised. After a storm occurs, puddles are natural temptations, but creeks, ditches, basically any area overflowing with water can be dangerous. Water does not always indicate its depth, and what looks like a shallow puddle may be a hole, several feet deep.</p>
